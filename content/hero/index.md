I'm a passionate Senior Blockchain Full Stack Developer who loves blockchain and fintech solutions.

I am always targeting to create valuable solutions that impact life and doing so by applying development best practices, methodologies, and building platforms easy to use. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I enjoy learning new skills and implementing them in real life!
